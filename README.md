## Files and Descriptions

1. **Data Exploration Parametric Methods.ipynb**  
   This notebook focuses on exploring datasets using parametric statistical techniques. It covers the assumptions made in parametric analysis, including normality, and demonstrates how to derive meaningful insights from such methods. Examples include t-tests, regression diagnostics, and confidence intervals.

2. **Data Exploration using Non-Parametric Methods.ipynb**  
   Non-parametric methods are useful when data does not meet the assumptions required by parametric tests. This notebook explains techniques such as the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and kernel density estimation, showcasing how to explore data distributions and relationships effectively.

3. **Regression Analysis.ipynb**  
   Regression forms the backbone of many predictive modeling tasks. This notebook covers linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression. It also discusses performance metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate model effectiveness.

4. **LDA & LR.ipynb**  
   This notebook introduces two classification techniques: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR). LDA focuses on dimensionality reduction while preserving class separability, whereas LR provides a probabilistic approach to binary and multi-class classification problems.

5. **KNN.ipynb**  
   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet effective supervised learning algorithm. This notebook explores its workings, including the importance of choosing the right value of 'k,' distance metrics, and the impact of feature scaling on model performance.

6. **Kernel Machines: SVM.ipynb**  
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful algorithms for classification and regression tasks. This notebook explains kernel functions like linear, polynomial, and RBF, and demonstrates their applications in handling non-linear decision boundaries.

7. **MLP Classifier.ipynb**  
   Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward neural network widely used for classification. This notebook explores the architecture of MLPs, including hidden layers and activation functions, and implements a classifier for multi-class problems using backpropagation.

8. **K-Means Clustering.ipynb**  
   K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm for grouping similar data points. This notebook walks through the clustering process, including centroid initialization, iterative updates, and the Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection.

9. **PCA.ipynb**  
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps in simplifying datasets while retaining their variance. This notebook explains eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and demonstrates how PCA can be used for visualization and speeding up computations in high-dimensional data.

10. **Multi Dimensional Scaling.ipynb**  
   Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a visualization technique for representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. This notebook discusses distance matrices, stress functions, and practical applications of MDS in understanding data relationships.

11. **Ensemble Learning.ipynb**  
   Ensemble methods leverage multiple models to improve predictive performance. This notebook explores popular techniques like bagging, boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), and stacking. It highlights how combining weak learners can lead to strong overall predictions.
